OUR IDEA IS AN AI TRIP PALNNER 
WE WOULD MAKE A MOBILE APP THAT WOULD MAKE THE USER CHOOSE SOME EXPLICIT 
CHOICES AND ACCORDING TO HIS CHOICES WE WOULD MAKE A PLAN AND RETURN IT TO HIM

WHAT I AM DOING IN THAT PROJECT :
I AM DOING THE AI PART WEHRE I FIRST GOT THE DATASET FROM YEILD WEBSITE FOR BUSINESS DATASETS AND APPLY COME PREPROCESSING TECHQ. ON

THEN I WOULD MAKE THE PLANNER PART WHERE I FIRST GET THE USER PREF. AS THE INPUT AS FROM MY YEILD DATASET I GET THE MOST SIMILLAR ROWS TO THE USER PREF FEATURES USING CONTENT BASED FILTERING AND multi criteria decision analysis THEN I CHOOSE FROM THESE ROWS THE BEST FOR THE USER USING THE DATA I COLLECTED FROM HIM WHILE SEEING THE PLAN I SHOWED HIM, AS THERE IS A LIKE BUTTON AND DISLIKE BUTTON ON EACH PLACE ON EACH DAY, AND THERE IS ALSO SOME TAGES ON EACH BUSSNIESS LIKE ITS WHAT EXACTLY AND WHILE HIM LIKEING OR DISLIKING THAT PLACES I STORE THIS INFO AND USE IT WITH THE INFO I GOT FROM HIM IN THE FIRST TIME HE OPEND THE APP, AS THE FIRST TIME HE OPENS THE APP I GIVE HIM SOME TAGES AND HE CLIKCS ON EACH IF HE LIKES SOME OF THEM LIKE IN REDDIT, AND I DO THIS LEARNING BY RL AGENT THAT SEES WHICH THINGS HE DISLIKED AND SEE THE TAGES ON THAT PLACE AND DO NOT RECOMMEND PLACES WITH THE SAME TAGES AND RECOMMEND MORE WITH THE PLACES THAT HAS TAGES HE LIKED


BUT I HAVE A QUESTION TO U AND ITS :
I WANT TO GET HIS PREFRENCES ALSO FROM HIS INTERACTION FROM THE SOCIAL MEDIA APP THAT IS WITHIN THE SAME APPLICATION, SO FOR EXAMPLE IF HE LIKED A PHOTO AND THIS PHOTO IS IN SPECIFIC PLACE I RECOMMEND THIS PLACE IN THE PLANNER LATER, AND IF HE LIKED SPEIFIC TYPE OF CUSINE I RECOMMEND A PLACE THAT HAS THIS TYPE OF CUSINE IN THE PLANNER LATER, SO HOW DO U THINK I SHOULD DO THAT.

AS I THINK I SHOULD CLASSIFY EACH PIC ON ITS OWN AND THEN GIVE THE RL AGENT THE TAGES THAT HE LIKES FROM THOSE POSTS HE LIKED
