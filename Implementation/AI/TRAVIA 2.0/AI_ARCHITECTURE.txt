   - **STREAMLINED**: Metadata preference integration (8 focused features)
   - Effective cuisine preference integration with smart conflicts
   - Learned pattern application with intelligent cuisine avoidance
   - **Balanced Content Filtering Pipeline**:

     * Filters each category separately to maintain 70/30 balance
     * Prevents single cuisine dominance during filtering stage
   - **Enhanced scoring system**:
     * Primary cuisines: 1.0-1.2 boost (strong preference)
     * Secondary cuisines: 0.5 boost (medium preference)
     * Category matches: 0.6 boost (broader matching)
     * Avoided cuisines: -1.0 penalty (skip entirely)
   - Metadata preference integration (0.6 weight multiplier)
   - Aggressive filtering based on negative patterns with variety preservation

5. EFFECTIVE CUISINE PREFERENCE ENGINE v2.0
-------------------------------------------
Dynamic preference combination with smart conflict resolution:

   - Filtering Level: Separate filtering of preferred/variety categories
   - Final Result: Maintained 70/30 balance after all processing stages
   
   **Enhanced Business Selection Logic**:
   1. **Multiple Cuisine Balancing**: Equal allocation per selected cuisine
   2. **Priority Query**: Balanced businesses matching effective cuisine preferences
   3. **Variety Query**: Diverse businesses excluding preferred/avoided cuisines
   4. **Balanced Filtering**: Split and filter categories separately

   - **No Duplicates**: Each business appears only once across entire itinerary
   
   **Business Categorization Engine**:
   ```
   BREAKFAST: good_for_breakfast=true OR (is_cafe=true AND fake_cuisine='Coffee')
   LUNCH: good_for_lunch=true OR (is_restaurant=true AND NOT dessert-only)
   DINNER: good_for_dinner=true OR (is_restaurant=true AND NOT dessert-only)

├── Database Level: 175 preferred + 75 variety businesses
├── Filtering Level: Separate category filtering to preserve balance
└── Final Result: Maintained 70/30 ratio after all processing

**Multi-Stage Selection Pipeline**:

**Stage 1: Database Query Strategy**

  ```
  preferred_businesses = [b for b in businesses if cuisine in all_preferred_cuisines]
  variety_businesses = [b for b in businesses if cuisine not in all_preferred_cuisines]
  
  filtered_preferred = content_filter(preferred_businesses, limit=175)
  filtered_variety = content_filter(variety_businesses, limit=75)
  
  final_businesses = filtered_preferred + filtered_variety  # Maintains 70/30
  ```
